            <p>Moisés Lino e Silva is a social anthropologist, professor at the Federal University of Bahia in Brazil and a World Social Science fellow of the International Social Science Council. He is originally from Goiás.[3] The scholar is an editorial board member of Cadernos de Campo, an anthropology journal published by the University of São Paulo. In 2019, he won the Global Religion Research Initiative Award, given by the University of Notre Dame. Lino e Silva was also named an ALARI Fellow (2019-2020) at Harvard University. He was appointed visiting associate professor in women's and gender studies at Harvard University in the Fall 2023, where he taught "Queer Lives in the Global South" and "Queer Ethnographies. Lino e Silva's field of focus is that of political anthropology, with a specialty in the ethnographic study of liberty and authority. This is examined in relation to issues such as poverty, sexuality, race, and religion. His initial in-field research considered the aspects and issues of freedom as experienced and perceived by slum dwellers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and more recently in Nigeria. Lino e Silva is the author of Minoritarian Liberalism: A Travesti Life in a Brazilian Favela, published by the University of Chicago Press in 2022, which focuses on Black people, children, and LGBTQ people, especially travestis, in a favela or working-class, poor community in Rio de Janeiro. 
            Minoritarian Liberalism has been reviewed by different independent outlets, such as the Allegra Lab and in ReVista: Harvard Review of Latin America. A review essay by Stephanie Clare in Feminist Theory, published by Oxford University Press, cites this work among "powerful contributions invested in what we might call decolonial freedom.</p>
